# Phishing Email Detector: An NLP Approach

## Abstract

In the evolving landscape of digital communication, phishing attacks have emerged as a predominant cybersecurity threat. This project endeavors to harness the capabilities of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to develop a sophisticated tool that can discern and flag potential phishing emails with a high degree of accuracy.

## Introduction

Phishing attacks, characterized by deceptive emails aiming to illicitly obtain sensitive information, have seen a significant surge in recent years. The objective of this research-driven project is to amalgamate the principles of cybersecurity with advanced machine learning techniques to enhance the security robustness of email communication.

## Objectives

- **Precision and Recall**: Employ pre-trained models, subsequently fine-tuned, to achieve optimal precision and recall metrics in the detection of phishing emails.
- **Real-time Analysis**: Architect the system to provide instantaneous feedback to users regarding potential email threats.
- **User Interface Design**: Prioritize the development of an intuitive interface or integration mechanism to ensure user accessibility and ease of use.

## Methodology

1. **Data Utilization**: Source and utilize publicly available datasets comprising both phishing and legitimate emails, ensuring a comprehensive foundation for model validation and training.
2. **Model Adaptation**: Leverage state-of-the-art pre-trained NLP models, refining them to cater specifically to the nuances of phishing email detection.
3. **System Integration**: Strategize the deployment of the refined model into a user-centric platform, be it a browser extension, email plugin, or a standalone application.
4. **Iterative Refinement**: Commit to a continuous cycle of model refinement, ensuring adaptability to the ever-evolving strategies employed in phishing attacks.
